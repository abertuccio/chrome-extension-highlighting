# HGLT
#### What is it for?
HGLT is primarily designed to learn languages while you visit web sites, but it could be used to learn or remember many things.
#### Mainly features
When HGTL is active and available on certain web site we can:
- Select a word or phrase 
- HGLT opens a new pinned tab and looks up the word or phrase for you. 
- Also, it opens a new pinned tab and looks for the images for you. 
- Then, HGLT put all the results in a tooltip near the selection.
- In that tooltip, we could also hear the pronunciation of that word or phrase. 
- You can store that word or phrase and the information collected.
- You can also study those elements using the sm2 algorithm. The same used by Memrise, Duolingo or Ankidroid.
- In the study section, you can also test your pronunciation against the original pronunciation.
##### Settings
We can choose what to see in the tooltip and what languages to use. Depends on what you want to study you coud change the settings to feel confortable.

##### Different approaches
- We could use all the features and translate for example from Spanish to English:

- We could set English to English and set only definitions. So the tooltip will try to translate from English to English and we see only the definition:
