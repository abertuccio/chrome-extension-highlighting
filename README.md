# HGLT
#### What is it for?
HGLT is primarily designed to learn languages while you visit web sites, but it could be used to learn or remember many things.
#### Mainly features
When HGTL is active and available on certain web site we can:
- Select a word or phrase 
- HGLT opens a new pinned tab and looks up the word or phrase for you. 
- Also, it opens a new pinned tab and looks for the images for you. 
- Then, HGLT put all the results in a tooltip near the selection.
- In that tooltip, we could also hear the pronunciation of that word or phrase. 
- You can store that word or phrase and the information collected.
- You can also study those elements using the same algorithm as Memrise, Duolingo or Ankidroid.
- In the study section, you can also test your pronunciation against the original pronunciation.
##### Settings
We can choose what to see in the tooltip and what languages to use. Depends on what you want to study you coud change the settings to feel confortable.

##### Different approaches
- We could use all the features and translate for example from Spanish to English:

<table><tr><td>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/M8e0rYq.png" />
</td></tr></table>

- We could set English to English and set only definitions. So the tooltip will try to translate from English to English and we see only the definition:

<table><tr><td>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vavTxTo.png" />
</td></tr></table>

##### Study

Since we store elements, a badge appears in the popup menu:

<table><tr><td>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8ntRtHg.png" />
</td></tr></table>

Each day, a badge warns you about the items available to study that day. In each study session, you should evaluate how well you remembered that element and the algorithm decides when it will be the best time to revisit that element.
